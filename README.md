# embedded-rust

_Rust Inside Other Languages_ is the third project included in [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.

It's intended to show off one of Rust's greatest strengths: a lack of a substantial runtime.

> Rust has support for _FFI_ (foreign function interface) in both directions: it can call into C code easily, but crucially, it can also be called into as easily as C. Combined with Rust's lack of a garbage collector and low runtime requirements, this makes Rust a great candidate to embed inside of other languages when you need that extra oomph.
